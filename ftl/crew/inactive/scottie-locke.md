## Background

Cool under pressure, Scottie always has a grin on his face - even when the ship is on fire, or he's about to wreck & kill everyone. He trusts instinct over orders and believes freedom is the only true currency.

Once a rising star in a corporate flight program, Scottie broke ranks after refusing to run weapons to a war-torn colony. Now he flies for the Lurian Rangers.
