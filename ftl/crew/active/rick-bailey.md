## Background

Notorious for his prowess in combat, Rick always prefers brawn over brains. He worked for various mercenary teams as the muscle of the group. Tough and ruthless, he usually opts to strike first, ask questions later. He is willing to do most anything, as long as the price is right.

After laying low from a job-gone-wrong, Rick was picked up by the Lurian Rangers who he now works with.
