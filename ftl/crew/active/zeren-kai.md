## Background

Unflinching and analytical, Zeren Kai sees the world as patterns to exploit and weaknesses to erase.

Tired of killing for petty warlords and corrupted guilds, Zeren Kai joined the Lurian Rangers to wield his skills for something larger than survivalâ€”a fractured galaxy in need of order, however brutal.
