# Mission Log 001: First Contact

## Initial Discovery

While conducting routine patrol operations in the Kepler-442 system, our long-range sensors detected an anomalous signature approximately 2.3 AU from our position. The contact appeared to be a derelict vessel drifting in the outer system, showing minimal power signatures but no active communications.

## Approach and Investigation

Captain Martinez ordered a cautious approach. As we closed distance, our tactical officer identified the vessel as the UES Icarus, a research ship that had been reported missing three months prior. The ship appeared intact but was completely dark except for emergency lighting.

## Boarding Operation

An away team consisting of Commander Torres, Chief Engineer Kim, and Medical Officer Chen boarded the vessel. What they found was... unsettling. The crew quarters were empty, but there were signs of a hasty evacuation. Personal effects were scattered, and several bulkheads showed signs of plasma scoring.

## The Discovery

In the main laboratory, the team discovered the remains of what appeared to be an experimental FTL drive variant. The research logs indicated the crew had been working on instantaneous travel technology - something that should have been impossible with current physics.

## Aftermath

We recovered the research data and brought the Icarus back to the nearest starbase. The implications of their research are still being analyzed by fleet command. Three crew members reported strange dreams following the mission, though medical scans show no abnormalities.

## Conclusions

This mission has raised more questions than it answered. The disappearance of the Icarus crew remains a mystery, and the nature of their research suggests there may be aspects of FTL travel we don't yet understand.

**Status**: Mission Complete - Data forwarded to Fleet Research Division
**Casualties**: None
**Recommendations**: Continued monitoring of experimental FTL research projects
