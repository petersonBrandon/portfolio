title: "Mission Log 001: First Patrol – Distress Signal"
date: "2401.156"
earthDate: 7/24/2025
crew: Captain Zeren Kai, Gunner Rick Bailey, Max “Robocop” – Experimental Law Enforcement Companion Unit
---

The orders were clear: respond to the **distress signal** from **Vebos Station**, a small scientific outpost built on the surface of a barren moon. The signal had been weak, tangled in a web of EM interference, but unmistakable in tone—urgent, panicked. A Laurian Ranger scout ship was dispatched with a three-person crew: **Zeren Kai**, the mission's commanding officer; **Rick Bailey**, gunner and weapons specialist; and **Max**, an experimental law enforcement unit nicknamed **Robocop**.

As they neared the moon, the signal noise worsened—then came the ambush.

Three fighters dropped in from high orbit, pushing hard toward the Rangers. Light, fast, and sloppily flown, they made up for poor skill with erratic aggression. The initial shots screamed wide, one fighter nearly burning out its engine trying to close the gap. From the cockpit, Max’s synthetic reflexes kept the ship clear of fire. Rick took aim, but the distance was still too great.

Zeren’s first orders in combat were shaky. The tension was thick—until he found his rhythm. Max tried locking in attack vectors, while Rick returned fire, missing again. The fighters pressed. Each enemy attempt—attack runs, vector changes—failed to yield anything meaningful. Still, the tide shifted again and again.

Then came the breakthrough.

Max maneuvered sharply. Rick’s fire finally struck **Fighter One**, damaging the engines. The resulting shrapnel scattered, lightly scarring Fighters Two and Three. Pressing the advantage, Rick followed up with another burst, striking Fighter One’s cockpit. The ship spiraled toward the moon, dead.

The other two fired back, but their rounds did little more than register on the ship’s hull plating. The crew—working in sync now—traded volleys with their opponents as the distance closed to knife-fight range. The ships coiled around each other in a spiral pattern.

Another clean shot from Rick disabled **Fighter Two’s** weapon systems. The pilot panicked, attempted a ram, and failed miserably—sending the ship into a freefall to the moon’s surface.

**Fighter Three**, desperate, managed a final hit with negligible impact. Rick returned fire and shredded the craft clean in half.

As the debris floated, Max scanned the wreckage. No lifeforms. No remains. **Drones**.

Zeren ordered descent. The hangar doors of **Vebos Station** were already open—unusual, but convenient. Inside, a single figure crossed the hangar in a scorched EVA suit, signaling toward the ship. Zeren opened comms.

“This is ship to hangar. We are responding to a distress signal.”

The suited figure sighed audibly and sealed the bay before depressurizing. Once it was safe, he removed his helmet, revealing a soot-covered face. His name was **Hakimi**, one of the station’s scientists.

The news was grim: a **raider attack** had left **four dead**, over a dozen wounded, and **six scientists kidnapped**. The station walls bore the signs—scorch marks, torn metal, dried blood.

Hakimi listed the missing:

- **Nadine Touma**, Planetary Oceanography
- **Shane Hillman**, Astrophysics
- **Noah Brann**, Xeno-microbiology
- **Thomas Anderson**, Medicine and Psionics
- **Mayra Reiss**, Plasma Physics
- **Tamar Pinera**, Metadimensional Astronomy

All had been attending a research conference—an assembly of brilliant minds from across the Learning Republic. It had only been hours since the assault.

Zeren requested station footage. Hakimi explained that their security systems had failed. The team was led to the chief engineer, **Prisko**, who explained that the feed had likely been **jammed or disabled** during the attack.

When pressed, Prisko admitted there’d been recent cuts to security funding, and three new contractors on station had raised suspicion:

- **Jaxon Chesson** – Technician
- **Isaac Magrala** – Technician
- **Rodmond Edgell** – Cook

Not suspects—just off.

The Rangers located Jaxon and Rodmond without issue. Isaac proved harder to find. When located, he was detained and questioned.

Isaac denied involvement, but his nervousness was obvious. Zeren applied pressure, and Isaac cracked.

He confessed to petty crimes, drug use, and underworld ties. Hoping to score substances rumored to accompany scientific conferences, Isaac had informed smugglers of the event. What he didn’t expect was that **raiders would arrive instead**, demanding names. Isaac gave them the top scientists. One of his contacts: **Vlad Losev**, an informant on **Nox Station**.

Isaac was placed under arrest.

---

Zeren asked Hakimi if the station needed medical aid—none urgently. Grateful, Hakimi thanked them for clearing the skies.

With Isaac in custody, the Rangers charted a course to Nox—a smuggler-run station carved into the ice of a remote moon.

Two days later, their ship touched down in a dim, freezing hangar. The schematic of the station had been etched into a steel slab bolted beside the exit hatch. The Rangers, in **civilian clothing**, carried **contraband** not for smuggling, but in case trade was necessary to gain access. No guards confronted them.

The walkways were narrow, the lights flickering. Everyone was armed. No one made eye contact.

They found **Vlad’s Bar** easily. The bouncer waved them in. Inside, the air was thick with smoke and tension. **Vlad**, sitting behind the counter, spotted the Rangers immediately—his eyes flicking toward two off-worlders sitting in a dark corner. At another table, two more strangers seemed to watch the first pair closely.

Zeren approached casually, made a joke, ordered drinks. Rick, pressing too hard, annoyed Vlad. Zeren defused the moment and took drinks to the corner booth.

The two men? **Dr. Thomas Anderson** and **Noah Brann**—two of the missing scientists. Slurring, they welcomed the company.

They explained that the raiders had separated them into two groups. One of the six, **Mayra Reiss**, was taken elsewhere. The others had been released—dropped into a HAB block. Naturally, they found a bar.

Zeren asked why Mayra alone had been separated. Anderson’s expression turned cautious.

“We should talk in private,” he said, motioning toward the HAB.

Meanwhile, Rick stayed behind, watching the bar. **Station security**, not thugs, approached him—one grabbing Rick by the collar.

“You wanna do this right now?” Rick asked coldly.

“Let’s take this outside.”

Max, watching silently, messaged Rick: _Need help?_

Rick nodded.

Outside, fists flew. G2 swung a stun prod. Max moved fast, locking him in a chokehold. Rick slugged G2, then tackled G1. After a brief but decisive scuffle, the guards surrendered. They weren’t acting on orders—they just made a habit of hazing strangers.

Zeren arrived just in time to see the last punch and shook his head.

---

Upstairs, the HAB was lightly guarded—two men at the door. The Rangers were let in without trouble. **Dr. Pinera** cooked over a stove while others rested.

They confirmed the raiders had come for **specific scientists**, not supplies. None of the raiders seemed experienced in flying. It wasn’t a pirate raid—it was **a targeted operation**.

Zeren asked about Mayra.

Anderson led him to a bedroom and spoke in a low voice. **Mayra Reiss**, he revealed, was undergoing training at the **Astrogation Academy’s Psionics College**—top-secret information. The institution was responsible for identifying and training **psions** capable of guiding ships through deep interstellar space safely—an ability that couldn’t be replicated by machines.

When pressed for more, Anderson said the raiders had a leader—**Miller**—some sort of commissar or political figure. In his presence, they shouted strange phrases:

> “Praise to the Emperor.”
> “Praise to the God-King.”

It had the flavor of a cult—but nothing was confirmed.

Zeren urged them to say nothing of the Rangers' identities.

When they exited the room, the hallway was no longer guarded by two men—**six** now stood waiting.

“Boss wants to see you,” one said.

Max stayed behind. Zeren and Rick were taken to the **Ops Center**.

---

There, in a fortified control room, sat **Mr. Keith Collins**—barely twenty, clearly in charge.

“I heard you roughed up some of my security,” he said, amused. Rick started to explain. Collins cut him off with a grin. “It was funny.”

He knew they were Rangers. Zeren confirmed it.

Collins leaned back in his chair. “Didn’t like the look of those raiders. You see them again—do us all a favor and put a bullet in them.”

Then he waved them off.

“Get the scientists out of here. They don’t belong. And neither do you.”
