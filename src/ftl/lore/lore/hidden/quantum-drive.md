# Quantum Drive Technology

## Overview

The Quantum Drive represents the pinnacle of human engineering achievement, enabling faster-than-light travel through manipulation of quantum spacetime. First developed in 2089 by the Terran Research Consortium, this technology fundamentally changed the nature of galactic civilization by making interstellar travel feasible on a large scale.

## Technical Principles

### Quantum Tunnel Formation

The quantum drive operates by creating localized distortions in spacetime, effectively "folding" space to reduce the distance between two points. This process involves:

- **Quantum Field Manipulation**: Generation of controlled quantum fields that interact with the fabric of spacetime
- **Dimensional Bridging**: Creation of temporary quantum tunnels through higher-dimensional space
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent timeflow during transit to prevent paradoxes

### Core Components

1. **Quantum Core**: The heart of the drive system, containing exotic matter in a controlled singularity
