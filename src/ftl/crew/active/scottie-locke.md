Cool under pressure, Scottie always has a grin on his face—even when the ship is on fire or he's about to wreck and kill everyone. He trusts instinct over orders and believes freedom is the only true currency.

## Background

Once a rising star in a corporate flight program, Scottie broke ranks after refusing to run weapons to a war-torn colony. Now he flies for the Lurian Rangers.

## Notable Attributes

- Flies like he was born in a cockpit—reckless but effective
- Pulls off insane maneuvers that defy flight protocols
- Fixes his own ship mid-fight without blinking
- Wears a patch from his old flight program as a reminder of who not to become
